Figure 23. Work continues on iss53
It’s worth noting here that the work you did in your hotfix 
branch is not contained in the files in your iss53 branch. 
If you need to pull it in, you can merge your master branch 
into your iss53 branch by running git merge master, or you 
can wait to integrate those changes until you decide to pull 
the iss53 branch back into master later.
